## Overview

LongAh! is a CLI-based application designed to help users track debts within friend groups and determine the least transaction method of settling these debts. It is optimized for busy people with large transaction quantities among friends. It is written in Java.

### Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Group List Handling
    * What it does: Manages a list of groups in the application. It allows users to create, load, switch between, add, and delete groups. 
    * Justification: Encapsulation of group-related data and behavior to promote code organization and modularity.
    * Highlights: Allows for user to create and handle multiple groups of people, each with their own set of transactions and members.

* **New Feature**: Transaction Settlement
    * What it does: This feature allows for users to settle debts among members within a group.
    * Justification: This simplifies the process of settling debts among members, ensuring that all debts are cleared with a single command.
    * Highlights: Handles cases where multiple transactions need to be created as the member owes multiple people by creating as many transactions as needed.

* **General Contributions**: Added Help Menu
    * What it does: Displays a list of available commands and their descriptions to the user.
    * Justification: Provides users with a quick reference to the available commands and their usage.
