## Overview

LongAh! is a CLI-based application designed to help users track debts within friend groups and determine the least transaction method of settling these debts. It is optimized for busy people with large transaction quantities among friends. It is written in Java.

### Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Group List Handling and Storage
    * What it does: Manages and stores a list of groups in the application. It allows users to create, load, switch between, add, and delete groups to manage transactions between different groups of people separately. 
    * Justification: Encapsulation of group-related data and behavior to promote code organization and modularity.
    * Highlights: Allows for user to create and handle multiple groups of people, each with their own set of transactions and members. Storage also allows for users to save and load groups for repeated future use.

* **New Feature**: Transaction Settlement
    * What it does: This feature allows for users to settle debts among members within a group.
    * Justification: This simplifies the process of settling debts among members, ensuring that all debts are cleared with a single command.
    * Highlights: Lumps all debts into a single transaction based on the least transactions solution, ensuring that all debts are cleared with a single transaction. This reduces the complexity of settling debts among members.

* **General Contributions**: Added Help Menu
    * What it does: Displays a list of all available commands and their descriptions to the user.
    * Justification: Provides users with a quick reference to all available commands and their usage.
